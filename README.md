# CLIgnore
> *clignorance is bliss*

CLIgnore is a simple command-line tool to find .gitignore files based on your language or framework. It uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to search for template files from GitHub's official [repo](https://github.com/github/gitignore), so you can automagically download and use them in your projects in no-time.

## Rationale
.gitignore files are annoying and I hate them. While many IDEs and version control tools generate .gitignore files for you, that's not always the case. So instead of constantly Googling for the gitignore repo, finding the right template, copying the template, and pasting it in my project *like a schmuck*... I made a tool that does it for me (and you!)

## Usage
![Usage Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Use `clignore find` to search based on your langauge or framework, and select the file you need. If clignore finds only 1 file matching what you search, it'll automatically download.
