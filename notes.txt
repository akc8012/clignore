Rust applications are not asynchronous by default
If you want to use asynchronous methods within our program, we need the `Tokio` framework
  `Tokio` is apparently an asynchronous runtime for Rust
  used in most reqwest examples
EXCEPT: If we use the (optional) blocking module, we dont need this junk :)
